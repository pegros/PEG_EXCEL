# SFPEG EXCEL Components
---


## Introduction

This package contains a set of LWC components primarily dedicated to the import and export of Salesforce
records from / to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets directly from the Lightning UX.

It leverages the opensource **[SheetJs](https://sheetjs.com/)** Javascript library to convert Excel 
spreadsheet data into/from JSON record arrays and adds a **[SLDS](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/)**
compliant UX layer to easily perform simple import/export operations.

These components were built as contributions/examples for former & ongoing Advisory assignments by 
[Pierre-Emmanuel Gros](https://github.com/pegros).
